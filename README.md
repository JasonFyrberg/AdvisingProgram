When making this program things got quite difficult when piecing together the core functions, mainly the "PrintCourse" function. Things were convoluted and difficult in regards to 
neatly sifting through the file and reorganizing all the data within it, but once I took my time and laid out my objectives rather than looking at the project as a whole, things became
much clearer. Data structures were difficult to learn and understand, however I know they are necessary in order to manipulate data in just about any way you could want, so I knew it
was a necessary struggle. I looked towards video games like I always do with my coding projects, and thought about how data structures could be applied to them, such as the player's
inventory, or storing a list of enemy's and their attributes. This methodology has greatly increased my understanding of data structures as well as my appreciation for them, and 
has shown me new methods of writing code, now I can manipulate data much better, and figuring out ways to do that efficiently and more modular is going to be a great tool in future
projects.
